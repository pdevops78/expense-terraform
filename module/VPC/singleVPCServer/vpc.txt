 Examples of Route Rules:
- Route to internet:
- Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
- Next hop: Internet Gateway
- Route to peer VPC:
- Destination: 10.20.0.0/16
- Next hop: Peering Connection
- Route through a VPN:
- Destination: 192.168.0.0/16
- Next hop: VPN Tunnel


VPN Gateway:(In companies)
---------------------------
- Create a custom VPC.
- Deploy the VPN gateway (host) inside that custom VPC.
- Set up a default VPC.
- Establish VPC peering between the custom VPC (with VPN) and the default VPC.
ðŸ”“ Result: No Bastion Needed
You're absolutely correct â€” Bastion is not required in this setup if:
- You're connecting to the custom VPC via VPN, and
- There are valid routes and security rules that allow access from the VPN-connected subnet to the default VPC.


In Lab:
--------
1. create VPC
2. create subnets
3. attach peer connection between bastion vpc(default vpc) and custom vpc
4. create Route tables
5. edit routes
6. attach peer connection for route tables

Single server for each component:
=================================
If VM goes down then what is the availability of the application

====
Hardware can be a problem
Site can be a problem

Due to any natural calamities of our data centers can go down. How we design our application on availability?

multi subnets:
==============
1. create VPC
2. create frontend subnets
3. create backend subnets
4. create db subnets
5.

Module to Module communication:
-------------------------------
1. first module can expose the information
2. second module can read the information
3. to expose the information outside by using "output"
