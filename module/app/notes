when instances are created in subnets?

application server side:   security group
=========================================

who will access frontend ? public servers
server_app_cidr = var.public access

who will access backend? frontend servers and backend servers
server_app_cidr = var.frontend servers + var.backend servers

who will access mysql? backend servers
server_app_cidr = var.backend servers


Load balancer
==============
expose application outside
lb_server_cidr = ["0.0.0.0/0"]

frontend load balancer connects to backend load balancer
lb_server_cidr = var.frontend subnets


Redirect http to https



Master AMI standards:
---------------------
* get existing ami template,instance type and security group
* add terraform s3 bucket

creating custom AMI template is useful :
========================================
1. no need to create OS
2. install required configurations
3. OS related configs
4.run application

in future, we don't want to choose predefined OS , we can use custom AMI template .
if there is any changes in custom AMI template like package versions, again we have to recreate a new custom AMI image . it is just like a AMI is like a snapshot of a machine at a point in time.
